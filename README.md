This is the public repository of my PDP-Project

This is a website for my parents' vacation apartment.
The code for the website can be found in this repository. I made three pages for this website, a homepage, a page for the photos and a page for all the information.

My main goal was to be creative with the photos of the apartment. I didn't want to just put the photos next to eachother. That's why I created some kind of slideshow with CSS and JavaScript.

I also wanted to include some kind of way to book the apartment online. But I couldn't find a way that worked the way I wanted it. So I explained in the website that, for now, we arrange everything through mails, until I've found a way to complete the online reservation system.

For the webhosting I just used sinners. I will discuss later with my parents, that if they really want to publish this website, that we look for a more professional webhost where we can use our own url.
